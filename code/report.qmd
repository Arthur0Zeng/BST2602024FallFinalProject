# Methods

The data used in this project are from multiple sources, including COVID-19 cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and vaccination records from CDC APIs, state-level population estimates from the US Census Bureau, and state-to-region mappings from publicly available JSON files. Data preprocessing involved cleaning, aggregating, and joining datasets by state and week using the CDC’s MMWR format. Rates per 100,000 people were calculated for comparability across states and time periods. All programming was conducted in the R language. 

The pandemic was divided into three periods based on time-series trends: (1) starting from the initial global outbreak (Jan 25, 2020 – Feb 28, 2021), characterized by the first significant wave of COVID-19; (2) the beginning of the Delta Variant Surge (Mar 1, 2021 – Nov 30, 2021), marked by a rise in cases and deaths associated with the Delta variant; and (3) seeing the Omicron wave (Dec 1, 2021 – Apr 29, 2023), notable for a sharp increase in cases but a lower mortality rate due to widespread vaccinations. 

State-level death rates were calculated for each period, and trends in hospitalization and death rates were analyzed to assess changes in virulence over time. Visualizations, including time-series plots and bar charts, were created using ggplot2 to support these analyses. 

# Results

The COVID-19 pandemic was divided into three periods based on the observed trends in case and death rates across the US states, as well as outside information. From Figure 1, three major peaks were defined to be both present in case and death rate. They corresponded to and included the initial global outbreak, Delta Variant surge, and the Omicron wave; this was matched to information given by the official CDC website. The initial global outbreak (Jan 25, 2020 – Feb 28, 2021) is marked by the first large peak in cases and deaths, with a steep rise in both metrics during late 2020 and early 2021. The Delta Variant surge (Mar 1, 2021 – Nov 30, 2021) shows a distinct increase in both case and death rates, albeit with a broader and steady peak. Lastly, the Omicron wave (Dec 1, 2021 – Apr 29, 2023) features a sharp, high spike in case rates but a comparatively smaller rise in death rates, suggesting a shift in the pandemic dynamics and the advancements in scientific discoveries (widespread of vaccines). 

State-level death rates varied significantly across the defined periods. From Figure 2, it can be clearly seen that in period (1), states like Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Mississippi reported the highest death rates, reflecting the early and severe impact of the pandemic in these regions, with Vermont and Hawaii at the lowest death rates. During the (2) phase, West Virginia, Florida, and Tennessee experienced the highest death rates, while Vermont, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island showed the lowest death rates. In (3) time period, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio had the highest death rates, while Alaska, Hawaii, and Vermont had the lowest death rates. Interestingly, Vermont, Hawaii, and Alaska remains having the lowest death rates throughout the pandemic, possibly due to a small population and less ability to spread the disease. 

The virulence of COVID-19 appeared to decrease over time, as evidenced by Figure 3. In (1), the vaccination (regular and booster, which has not been available yet) remains to be almost 0; the hospitalization rate increases rapidly in this time period. In (2), the regular series is increasing and people also begin to take booster vaccines; the hospitalization rate is not as high as (1). There is a large peak of hospitalization in (3) but declines quickly, possibly due to high vaccination (including booster) rates. This conclusion can also be explained by a decreasing death rate.
