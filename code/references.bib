	abstract = {COVID-19 is a global pandemic with uncertain death rates. We examined county-level population morality rates (per 100,000) and case fatality rates by US region and rural-urban classification, while controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and hospital variables. We found that population mortality rates and case fatality rates were significantly different across region, rural-urban classification, and their interaction. All significant comparisons had p {\textless} 0.001. Northeast counties had the highest population mortality rates (27.4) but had similar case fatality rates (5.9\%) compared to other regions except the Southeast, which had significantly lower rates (4.1\%). Population mortality rates were highest in urban counties but conversely, case fatality rates were highest in rural counties. Death rates in the Northeast were driven by urban areas (e.g., small, East Coast states), while case fatality rates tended to be highest in the most rural counties for all regions, especially the Southwest. However, on further inspection, high case fatality rate percentages in the Southwest, as well as in overall US counties, were driven by a low case number. This makes it hard to distinguish genuinely higher mortality or an artifact of a small sample size. In summary, coronavirus deaths are not homogenous across the United States but instead vary by region and population and highlight the importance of fine-scale analysis.},

            Background
            The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus greatly affected healthcare workers and healthcare systems. It also challenged schools and universities worldwide negatively affecting in-person education. We conducted this study is to assess the evolution of SARs-CoV-2 virulence over the course of the pandemic.
          
          
            Methods
            
              A combined cohort of affiliates from the University of Navarra, two hospitals in Spain, and one healthcare system in the Greater Boston area was followed prospectively from March 8
              th
              , 2020, to January 31
              st
              , 2022 for diagnosis with COVID-19 by PCR testing and related sequelae. Follow-up time was divided into four periods according to distinct waves of infection during the pandemic. Severity of COVID-19 was measured by case-hospitalization rate. Descriptive statistics and multivariable-adjusted statistics using the Poisson mixed-effects regression model were applied.
            
          
          
            Results
            
              For the last two periods of the study (January 1
              st
              to December 15

              to May 31
              st
              , 2020), the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of hospitalization were 0.08 (95\% CI, 0.03-0.17) and 0.03 (95\% CI, 0.01-0.15), respectively.
            
          
          
            Interpretation
            The virulence of COVID-19 and immunity of our populations evolved over time, resulting in a decrease in case severity. We found the case-hospitalization rate decreased more than 90\% in our cohort despite an increase in incidence.},

This study tests if and how county-level rates of infection and death have changed in relation to societal county characteristics through time as the pandemic progressed. This longitudinal study sampled monthly county-level COVID-19 case and death data per 100,000 residents from April 2020 to March 2022, and studied the relationships of these variables with racial/ethnic, demographic, health, and socioeconomic characteristics for 3125 or 97.0\% of U.S. counties, accounting for 96.4\% of the U.S. population. The association of all county-level characteristics with COVID-19 case and death rates changed significantly through time, and showed different patterns. For example, counties with higher population proportions of Black, Native American, foreign-born non-citizen, elderly residents, households in poverty, or higher income inequality suffered disproportionately higher COVID-19 case and death rates at the beginning of the pandemic, followed by reversed, attenuated or fluctuating patterns, depending on the variable. Patterns for counties with higher White versus Black population proportions showed somewhat inverse patterns. Counties with higher female population proportions initially had lower case rates but higher death rates, and case and death rates become more coupled and fluctuated later in the pandemic. Counties with higher population densities had fluctuating case and death rates, with peaks coinciding with new variants of COVID-19. Counties with a greater proportion of university-educated residents had lower case and death rates throughout the pandemic, although the strength of this relationship fluctuated through time. This research clearly shows that how different segments of society are affected by a pandemic changes through time. Therefore, targeted policies and interventions that change as a pandemic unfolds are necessary to mitigate its disproportionate effects on vulnerable populations, particularly during the first six months of a pandemic.},

          Different estimation methods produce diverging accounts of racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 mortality in the United States. The CDC‚Äôs decision to present the racial/ethnic distribution of COVID-19 deaths at the state level alongside re-weighted racial/ethnic population distributions‚Äîin effect, a geographic adjustment‚Äîmakes it seem that Whites have the highest death rates. Age adjustment procedures used by others, including the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, lead to the opposite conclusion that Blacks and Hispanics are dying from COVID-19 at higher rates than Whites. In this paper, we use indirect standardization methods to adjust per-capita death rates for both age and geography simultaneously, avoiding the one-sided adjustment procedures currently in use. Using CDC data, we find age-and-place-adjusted COVID-19 death rates are 80\% higher for Blacks and more than 50\% higher for Hispanics, relative to Whites, on a national level, while there is almost no disparity for Asians. State-specific estimates show wide variation in mortality disparities. Comparison with non-epidemic mortality reveals potential roles for pre-existing health disparities and differential rates of infection and care.},

	abstract = {Comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries or across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the expected mortality, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no global, frequently updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly all-cause mortality data from 103 countries and territories, openly available as the regularly updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that in several worst-affected countries (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) the excess mortality was above 50\% of the expected annual mortality (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) or above 400 excess deaths per 100,000 population (Peru, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Serbia). At the same time, in several other countries (e.g. Australia and New Zealand) mortality during the pandemic was below the usual level, presumably due to social distancing measures decreasing the non-COVID infectious mortality. Furthermore, we found that while many countries have been reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, some countries have been substantially underreporting their COVID-19 deaths (e.g. Nicaragua, Russia, Uzbekistan), by up to two orders of magnitude (Tajikistan). Our results highlight the importance of open and rapid all-cause mortality reporting for pandemic monitoring.
          , 
            Countries around the world reported 4.2 million deaths from SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) from the beginning of pandemic until the end of July 2021, but the actual number of deaths is likely higher. While some countries may have imperfect systems for counting deaths, others may have intentionally underreported them. To get a better estimate of deaths from an event such as a pandemic, scientists often compare the total number of deaths in a country during the event to the expected number of deaths based on data from previous years. This tells them how many excess deaths occurred during the event.
            To provide a more accurate count of deaths caused by COVID-19, Karlinsky and Kobak built a database called the World Mortality Dataset. It includes information on deaths from all causes from 103 countries. Karlinsky and Kobak used the database to compare the number of reported COVID-19 deaths reported to the excess deaths from all causes during the pandemic.
            Some of the hardest hit countries, including Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Mexico, experienced over 50\% more deaths than expected during the pandemic. Meanwhile, other countries like Australia and New Zealand, reported fewer deaths than normal. This is likely because social distancing measures reduced deaths from infections like influenza. Many countries reported their COVID-19 deaths accurately, but Karlinsky and Kobak argue that other countries, including Nicaragua, Russia, and Uzbekistan, underreported COVID-19 deaths.
            Using their database, Karlinsky and Kobak estimate that, in those countries, there have been at least 1.4 times more deaths due to COVID-19 than reported ‚Äì adding over 1 million extra deaths in total. But they note that the actual number is likely much higher because data from more than 100 countries were not available to include in the database. The World Mortality Dataset provides a more accurate picture of the number of people who died because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is available online and updated daily. The database may help scientists develop better mitigation strategies for this pandemic or future ones.},

	abstract = {Background
              There has been considerable international variation in mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to investigate the differences between mortality registered as due to COVID-19 and the excess all-cause mortality reported in countries worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic.
            
            
              Methods
              Ecological analysis of 22 countries compared 5-year historical all-cause mortality, reported all-cause mortality and expected all-cause mortality (calculated as historical mortality plus the reported deaths attributed to COVID-19). Data available from the first week of January 2020 to that most recently available were analysed.
            
            
              Results
              Compared to the preceding 5 years, there was an excess of 716‚Ää616 deaths, of which 64.3\% were attributed to COVID-19. The proportion of deaths registered as COVID-19-related/excess deaths varied markedly between countries, ranging between 30\% and 197\% in those countries that had an excess of deaths during the period of observation. In most countries where a definite peak in COVID-19-related deaths occurred, the increase in reported all-cause mortality preceded the increase in COVID-19 reported mortality. During the latter period of observation, a few countries reported fewer all-cause deaths than the historical figures.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The increases in all-cause mortality preceded the increase in COVID-19 mortality in most countries that had definite spikes in COVID-19 mortality. The number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 was underestimated by at least 35\%. Together these findings suggest that calculation of excess all-cause mortality is a better predictor of COVID-19 mortality than the reported rates, in those countries experiencing definite increases in mortality.},

              One year after its emergence, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become so widespread that there is little hope of elimination. There are, however, several other human coronaviruses that are endemic and cause multiple reinfections that engender sufficient immunity to protect against severe adult disease. By making assumptions about acquired immunity from its already endemic relatives, Lavine
              et al.
              developed a model with which to analyze the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 into endemicity. The model accounts for SARS-CoV-2's age-structured disease profile and assesses the impact of vaccination. The transition from epidemic to endemic dynamics is associated with a shift in the age distribution of primary infections to younger age groups, which in turn depends on how fast the virus spreads. Longer-lasting sterilizing immunity will slow the transition to endemicity. Depending on the type of immune response it engenders, a vaccine could accelerate establishment of a state of mild disease endemicity.

          , 
            We are currently faced with the question of how the severity of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may change in the years ahead. Our analysis of immunological and epidemiological data on endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) shows that infection-blocking immunity wanes rapidly but that disease-reducing immunity is long-lived. Our model, incorporating these components of immunity, recapitulates both the current severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the benign nature of HCoVs, suggesting that once the endemic phase is reached and primary exposure is in childhood, SARS-CoV-2 may be no more virulent than the common cold. We predict a different outcome for an emergent coronavirus that causes severe disease in children. These results reinforce the importance of behavioral containment during pandemic vaccine rollout, while prompting us to evaluate scenarios for continuing vaccination in the endemic phase.},

The inclusion criterion was the presence of COVID-19 diagnostic codes in electronic medical record or a positive laboratory test of the SARS-CoV-2. Statistical analysis was bifurcated into two components, longitudinal analysis and comparative analysis. To assess the discrepancies in hospitalization and mortality rates for COVID-19, we identified the prevailing periods for the Delta and Omicron variants.
            
            
              Results
              
                Longitudinal analysis demonstrated four sharp surges in the number of deaths and CFR. The CFR was persistently higher in males and older age. The CFR of Black and White remained higher than Asians since January 2022. In comparative analysis, the adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and hospitalization were higher in Delta wave compared to the Omicron wave. Risk of all-cause mortality was found to be greater 14‚Äì30‚Äâdays after a COVID-19 diagnosis, while the likelihood of hospitalization was higher in the first 14‚Äâdays following a COVID-19 diagnosis in Delta wave compared with Omicron wave. Kaplan‚ÄìMeier analysis revealed the cumulative probability of mortality was approximately 2-fold on day 30 in Delta than in Omicron cases (log-rank
                p
                ‚Äâ\&lt;‚Äâ0.001). The mortality risk ratio between the Delta and Omicron variants was 1.671 (95\% Cl 1.615‚Äì1.729, log-rank
                p
                ‚Äâ\&lt;‚Äâ0.001). Delta also had a significantly increased mortality risk over Omicron in all age groups. The CFR of people aged above 80‚Äâyears was extremely high as 17.33\%.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              Male sex and age seemed to be strong and independent risk factors of mortality in COVID-19. The Delta variant appears to cause more hospitalization and death than the Omicron variant.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          How might COVID-19 vaccines alter selection for increased SARS-CoV-2 virulence, or lethality? Framing current evidence surrounding SARS-CoV-2 biology and COVID-19 vaccines in the context of evolutionary theory indicates that prospects for virulence evolution remain uncertain. However, differential effects of vaccinal immunity on transmission and disease severity between respiratory compartments could select for increased virulence. To bound expectations for this outcome, we analyze an evo-epidemiological model. Synthesizing model predictions with vaccine efficacy data, we conclude that while vaccine driven virulence evolution remains a theoretical risk, it is unlikely to threaten prospects for herd immunity in immunized populations. Given that this event would nevertheless impact unvaccinated populations, virulence should be monitored to facilitate swift mitigation efforts.
          
            Significance statement
            Vaccines can provide personal and population level protection against infectious disease, but these benefits can exert strong selective pressures on pathogens. Virulence, or lethality, is one pathogen trait that can evolve in response to vaccination. We investigated whether COVID-19 vaccines could select for increased SARS-CoV-2 virulence by reviewing current evidence about vaccine efficacy and SARS-CoV-2 biology in the context of evolutionary theory, and subsequently analyzing a mathematical model. Our findings indicate that while vaccine-driven virulence evolution in SARS-CoV-2 is a theoretical risk, the consequences of this event would be limited for vaccinated populations. However, virulence evolution should be monitored, as the ramifications of a more virulent strain spreading into an under-vaccinated population would be more severe.},

	abstract = {ObjectivesThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental impact on healthcare utilisation, resulting in increased mortality both directly and indirectly associated with COVID-19. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all-cause and disease-specific mortality and further explore the impact of potential inequalities, deprivation status and ethnicity.
ApproachPopulation-scale, individual-level, anonymised linked, routinely-collected electronic health records from demographic and administrative sources were used for two cohorts: i) C19-COHORT16 included individuals alive and resident in Wales on the 1st January 2016 with follow-up until death, break-in Welsh residency, or 31st December 2019; ii) C19-COHORT20 included individuals alive and resident in Wales on 1st January 2020 with follow-up until death, break-in Welsh residency, or study end. We used time-series analysis to investigate trends in mortality over time. We fitted negative binomial models to estimate expected all-cause and disease-specific mortality and compared these estimates to observed mortality in C19-COHORT20.
ResultsExcess all-cause and COVID19-related deaths were higher during the period where the alpha variant was dominant. The trend in deaths decreased during the omicron dominant period. The Asian population had increased mortality during the period where the delta variant was dominant. Mortality was increased for most deprived groups compared to least deprived groups, however, the magnitude of this effect remained unchanged during the pandemic. COVID-19 indirectly affected cancer, circulatory, trauma, digestive and mental health related deaths, with a higher than expected mortality. The majority of trauma related deaths occurred early on in the pandemic, where a higher than expected number of deaths occurred outside of an NHS establishment. Mortality associated with respiratory disease (unrelated to COVID-19) was significantly lower than expected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
ConclusionIncreased all-cause and disease-specific mortality was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Excess deaths may be a result of reduced healthcare utilisation, delayed investigation and/or treatment of chronic diseases. As healthcare systems recover from COVID-19, investigation of mortality trends will play a central role in healthcare planning, utilisation and resource use.},

	abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, an excess of all-cause mortality has been recorded in several countries, including Peru. Most excess deaths were likely attributable to COVID-19. In this study, we compared the excess all-cause mortality and COVID-19 mortality in 25 Peruvian regions to determine whether most of the excess deaths in 2020 were attributable to COVID-19. Excess deaths were calculated as the difference between the number of observed deaths from all causes during the COVID-19 pandemic (in 2020) and the number of expected deaths in 2020 based on a historical from recent years (2017‚Äì2019). Death data were retrieved from the Sistema Informatico Nacional de Defunciones (SINADEF) at the Ministry of Health of Peru from January 2017 to December 2020. Population counts were obtained from projections from Peru‚Äôs Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica e Inform√°tica (INEI). All-cause excess mortality and COVID-19 mortality were calculated by region per 100,000 population. Spearman‚Äôs test and linear and multiple regression models were used to estimate the correlation between excess all-cause mortality and COVID-19 mortality per 100,000 population. Excess all-cause death rates varied widely among regions (range: 115.1 to 519.8 per 100,000 population), and COVID-19 mortality ranged between 83.8 and 464.6 per 100,000 population. There was a correlation between the all-cause excess mortality and COVID-19 mortality (r = 0.90; p = 0.00001; y = 0.8729x + 90.808; R2 = 0.84). Adjusted for confounding factors (mean age in the region, gender balance, and number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds), the all-cause excess mortality rate was correlated with COVID-19 mortality rate (Œ≤ = 0.921; p = 0.0001). These findings suggest that most of the excess deaths in Peru are related to COVID-19. Therefore, these findings can help decision-makers to understand the high COVID-19 mortality rates in Peru.},

	abstract = {Background: Currently, reported COVID-19 deaths are inadequate to assess the impact of the pandemic on global excess mortality. All-cause excess mortality is a WHO-recommended index for assessing the death burden of COVID-19. However, the global excess mortality assessed by this index remains unclear. We aimed to assess the global excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for studies published in English between 1 January 2020, and 21 May 2022. Cross-sectional and cohort studies that reported data about excess mortality during the pandemic were included. Two researchers independently searched the published studies, extracted data, and assessed quality. The Mantel‚ÄìHaenszel random-effects method was adopted to estimate pooled risk difference (RD) and their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 79 countries from twenty studies were included. During the COVID-19 pandemic, of 2,228,109,318 individuals, 17,974,051 all-cause deaths were reported, and 15,498,145 deaths were expected. The pooled global excess mortality was 104.84 (95\% CI 85.56‚Äì124.13) per 100,000. South America had the highest pooled excess mortality [134.02 (95\% CI: 68.24‚Äì199.80) per 100,000], while Oceania had the lowest [‚àí32.15 (95\% CI: ‚àí60.53‚Äì‚àí3.77) per 100,000]. Developing countries had higher excess mortality [135.80 (95\% CI: 107.83‚Äì163.76) per 100,000] than developed countries [68.08 (95\% CI: 42.61‚Äì93.55) per 100,000]. Lower middle-income countries [133.45 (95\% CI: 75.10‚Äì191.81) per 100,000] and upper-middle-income countries [149.88 (110.35‚Äì189.38) per 100,000] had higher excess mortality than high-income countries [75.54 (95\% CI: 53.44‚Äì97.64) per 100,000]. Males had higher excess mortality [130.10 (95\% CI: 94.15‚Äì166.05) per 100,000] than females [102.16 (95\% CI: 85.76‚Äì118.56) per 100,000]. The population aged ‚â• 60 years had the highest excess mortality [781.74 (95\% CI: 626.24‚Äì937.24) per 100,000]. Conclusions: The pooled global excess mortality was 104.84 deaths per 100,000, and the number of reported all-cause deaths was higher than expected deaths during the global COVID-19 pandemic. In South America, developing and middle-income countries, male populations, and individuals aged ‚â• 60 years had a heavier excess mortality burden.},

              Introduction
              While the increased burden of COVID-19 among the Black population has been recognized, most attempts to quantify the extent of this racial disparity have not taken the age distribution of the population into account. In this paper, we determine the Black‚ÄìWhite disparity in COVID-19 mortality rates across 35 states using direct age standardization. We then explore the relationship between structural racism and differences in the magnitude of this disparity across states.
            
            
              Methods
              Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we calculated both crude and age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rates for the non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black populations in each state. We explored the relationship between a state-level structural racism index and the observed differences in the racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality across states. We explored the potential mediating effects of disparities in exposure based on occupation, underlying medical conditions, and health care access.
            
            
              Results
              Relying upon crude death rate ratios resulted in a substantial underestimation of the true magnitude of the Black‚ÄìWhite disparity in COVID-19 mortality rates. The structural racism index was a robust predictor of the observed racial disparities. Each standard deviation increase in the racism index was associated with an increase of 0.26 in the ratio of COVID-19 mortality rates among the Black compared to the White population.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Structural racism should be considered a root cause of the Black‚ÄìWhite disparity in COVID-19 mortality. Dismantling the long-standing systems of racial oppression is critical to adequately address both the downstream and upstream causes of racial inequities in the disease burden of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Background
              Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) excess deaths refer to increases in mortality over what would normally have been expected in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Several prior studies have calculated excess deaths in the United States but were limited to the national or state level, precluding an examination of area-level variation in excess mortality and excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19. In this study, we take advantage of county-level variation in COVID-19 mortality to estimate excess deaths associated with the pandemic and examine how the extent of excess mortality not assigned to COVID-19 varies across subsets of counties defined by sociodemographic and health characteristics.
            
            
              Methods and findings
              In this ecological, cross-sectional study, we made use of provisional National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data on direct COVID-19 and all-cause mortality occurring in US counties from January 1 to December 31, 2020 and reported before March 12, 2021. We used data with a 10-week time lag between the final day that deaths occurred and the last day that deaths could be reported to improve the completeness of data. Our sample included 2,096 counties with 20 or more COVID-19 deaths. The total number of residents living in these counties was 319.1 million. On average, the counties were 18.7\% Hispanic, 12.7\% non-Hispanic Black, and 59.6\% non-Hispanic White. A total of 15.9\% of the population was older than 65 years. We first modeled the relationship between 2020 all-cause mortality and COVID-19 mortality across all counties and then produced fully stratified models to explore differences in this relationship among strata of sociodemographic and health factors. Overall, we found that for every 100 deaths assigned to COVID-19, 120 all-cause deaths occurred (95\% CI, 116 to 124), implying that 17\% (95\% CI, 14\% to 19\%) of excess deaths were ascribed to causes of death other than COVID-19 itself. Our stratified models revealed that the percentage of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 was substantially higher among counties with lower median household incomes and less formal education, counties with poorer health and more diabetes, and counties in the South and West. Counties with more non-Hispanic Black residents, who were already at high risk of COVID-19 death based on direct counts, also reported higher percentages of excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19. Study limitations include the use of provisional data that may be incomplete and the lack of disaggregated data on county-level mortality by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and sociodemographic and health characteristics.
            
            
              Conclusions
              In this study, we found that direct COVID-19 death counts in the US in 2020 substantially underestimated total excess mortality attributable to COVID-19. Racial and socioeconomic inequities in COVID-19 mortality also increased when excess deaths not assigned to COVID-19 were considered. Our results highlight the importance of considering health equity in the policy response to the pandemic.},

              Background
              Clinical severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may vary over time; trends in clinical severity at admission during the pandemic among hospitalized patients in the United States have been incompletely described, so a historical record of severity over time is lacking.
            
            
              Methods
              We classified 466677 hospital admissions for COVID-19 from April 2020 to April 2021 into 4 mutually exclusive severity grades based on indicators present on admission (from most to least severe): Grade 4 included intensive care unit (ICU) admission and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV); grade 3 included non-IMV ICU and/or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation; grade 2 included diagnosis of acute respiratory failure; and grade 1 included none of the above indicators. Trends were stratified by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and comorbid conditions. We also examined severity in states with high vs low Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant burden.
            
            
              Results
              Severity tended to be lower among women, younger adults, and those with fewer comorbidities compared to their counterparts. The proportion of admissions classified as grade 1 or 2 fluctuated over time, but these less-severe grades comprised a majority (75\%‚Äì85\%) of admissions every month. Grades 3 and 4 consistently made up a minority of admissions (15\%‚Äì25\%), and grade 4 showed consistent decreases in all subgroups, including states with high Alpha variant burden.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Clinical severity among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has varied over time but has not consistently or markedly worsened over time. The proportion of admissions classified as grade 4 decreased in all subgroups. There was no consistent evidence of worsening severity in states with higher vs lower Alpha prevalence.},
